# Lead Nurture Workflow – Example

This is a simplified, fictitious example of a nurture workflow inspired by real marketing operations.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Nurture new leads after they sign up for a discount or a newsletter.

---

## ⚡ Trigger
**Contact submits the form:**  
“Get 10% Off” / “Join Newsletter”

---

## 🛠️ Workflow Steps

1. **Send Email #1 – Welcome + Discount**  
   - Confirms subscription  
   - Gives the offer (discount code or freebie)

2. **Delay 1 day**

3. **If Email #1 is opened:**  
      → **Send Email #2 – How the product works / Key benefits**  
   **Else:**  
      → **Resend Email #1** with a different subject line

4. **Delay 2 days**

5. **Create a follow-up task** (for Sales or Support)  
   *“Check-in with this lead. They might be ready to convert.”*

6. **If lead makes a purchase:**  
      → Exit workflow  
   **Else:**  
      → Send Email #3 – “Offer ends in 24 hours”
